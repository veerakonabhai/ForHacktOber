Chef has a sequence of positive integers A1,A2,…,AN. He has only one question for you: is it possible to change at most K elements of this sequence to arbitrary positive integers in such a way that the condition
A21+A22+⋯+A2N≤A1+A2+⋯+AN
holds?

Input
The first line of the input contains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains two space-separated integers N and K.
The second line contains N space-separated integers A1,A2,…,AN.
Output
For each test case, print a single line containing the string "YES" if it is possible to satisfy the given condition or "NO" otherwise.

Constraints
1≤T≤1,000
1≤K≤N≤104
1≤Ai≤10 for each valid i
the sum of N over all test cases does not exceed 105
Subtasks
Subtask #1 (100 points): original constraints

Example Input
1
2 2
1 2
Example Output
YES
Explanation
Example case 1: It is possible to change A2 to 1. This gives A=[1,1], for which the given condition holds, so the answer is "YES".

Solution:
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

int main() {
	// your code goes here
	int t;
	cin>>t;
	while(t--)
	{
		int n,k;
		cin>>n>>k;
		int count=0,a[n];
		for(int i=0;i<n;i++)
		{
			cin>>a[i];
			if(a[i]!=1) count++;
		}
		if(count<=k) cout<<"YES\n";
		else cout<<"NO\n";
	}
	return 0;
}
